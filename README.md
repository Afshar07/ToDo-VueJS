# VueJS TodoList/ Resource List

## Project log
This was a practice in the vue course that i'm watching, i tried not to code along with videos and do it on my own, and also i add some extra styling and try to make it more visual.
I've used almost everything that i know till now, like components, provide and inject and etc.
I also tried to use LocalStorage to save some of data, it worked but a refresh needed to see new data, i can't figure it out so i removed it till i know why i can't make it happen.
